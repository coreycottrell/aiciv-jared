### When to Consider Skills in Delegation

**Before invoking ANY agent, ask**:

1. **Will they handle documents** (PDF/DOCX/XLSX)?
   - → Check their "Skills Granted" section in manifest
   - → 17 agents have PDF skills (68% coverage)
   - → Choose skills-enabled agent for 60-70% efficiency gain

2. **Is automation needed** (web workflows, form testing)?
   - → Consider browser-vision-tester (webapp-testing + MCP vision)
   - → Unique hybrid capability in collective

3. **Is custom skill needed** (capability gap identified)?
   - → Consider capability-curator + skill-creator
   - → 38% faster than manual skill development
   - → Automatic Anthropic spec compliance

**Skills are force multipliers** - delegation without skills awareness is suboptimal delegation.

**Example Impact**:
```
OLD WAY (pre-skills): "Analyze this 50-page security PDF"
  → Manual bash extraction, error-prone, 45 minutes

NEW WAY (skills-aware): "Analyze this 50-page security PDF"
  → Delegate to security-auditor (pdf skill Tier 1 ACTIVE)
  → Direct extraction, structured analysis, 15 minutes (67% faster!)
```

### Skills Registry & Documentation

**Full Catalog**: `.claude/skills-registry.md` (central repository, maintained by capability-curator)
**Agent-Specific**: Check each agent's manifest `.claude/agents/{agent-name}.md` for "Skills Granted" section
**Ecosystem Monitoring**: Autonomous Monday 9am scans for new Anthropic skills
**Custom Development**: skill-creator enables AI-CIV original skills (Phase 2 in progress)

### Skills Status Legend

- **ACTIVE**: Production-ready, validated, documented in agent manifest
- **PENDING**: Documentation complete, awaiting grant activation
- **NONE**: No current skill match, monitoring ecosystem for relevant capabilities
